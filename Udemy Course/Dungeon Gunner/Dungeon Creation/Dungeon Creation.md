1. Create 'Random' dungeons that appear different on each playthrough.
2. Maximize the use of the assets create and also give the player variation in their gameplay. 
3. A dungeon layout will be based on hierarchical graphs of connected room nodes.
4. These graphs can contain any number of room nodes linked by corridors.
5. each node in the graph will represent a dungeon room type by using node types in the graph.
6. There will be multiple room type for variation in gameplay. Entrance room node type , a small room node type , a medium room node type and a boss room node. 
7. Room templates will be hand built to provide well laid out dungeon rooms.

10. Dungeon building process 
	1. So for each dungeon level in the game have a number of predefined room node graphs with room types and connections between rooms,
