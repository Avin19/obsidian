In Unity ( and general game development), a Vector is a mathematical entity used to represent directions and positions in 2D or 3D space. vectors are often used to define movement, direction, velocity, and points in space. Unity provides `Vector2`, `Vector3`, and `Vector4`  structures to handle [[2D]] , [[3D]] , and [[4D]] vectors, respectively.

### Types of Vectors in Unity

1. Vector2 : Represents a 2D vector with X and Y coordinates. It's used in 2D games for positions, directions, and velocities.
```csharp
Vector2 myVector2 = new Vector2(1.0f, 3.5f);
```
