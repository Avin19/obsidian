Software #DesignPattern  are architectural approaches to designing code in a way that avoids or solves certain problems.

which can be important for avoiding bugs, and making a project easier to work on, especially as it gets bigger and more complex.


## Do you need to use a programming pattern when building a game in Unity ?

choosing whether or not to use a design pattern, and how strictly you follow it, depends massively on what it is you're making and how you're making it. 


## Why ? 

Because all design patterns are essentially , solutions to known or anticipated problems, which means that a patterns that's ideal in one use case, might be difficult to apply in another.


## What's More ? 

if you're an independent developer , working on your own Game, alone, a design pattern is only as useful as you find it to be , as strictly following a set of programming design rules can sometimes make your game harder to build instead of easier. 

## Which ?

which kind of defeats the point of design pattern in the first place. After all, strictly following a design principle does not automatically make a game good or efficient. 


### Benefits 

It should , however, make your game easier to build and, chances are, if you're anything like me, at least, you'll probably spend just as much time working out how the relationship between the code in your game should work as you'll spend actually writing it.
