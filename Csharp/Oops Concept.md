[[Object]]
[[Class]]
[[Inheritance]]
[[Encapsulation]]
[[Abstraction]]
[[Polymorphism]]

Oops -> [[Object]] oriented programming . It is the way to create software around [[Object]]. Which are instance of [[Class]]es. OOP focuses on using [[Object]]s and [[Class]]es to design software, offering various advantages such as modularity, reusability, scalability, and ease of maintenance. The four key pillars of OOP are [[Encapsulation]], [[Abstraction]], [[Inheritance]], and [[Polymorphism]]. Here's a detailed breakdown of these concepts:

### Advantage of OOPs

1. Reuse of code  [[Inheritance]]
2. Flexibility of code [[Polymorphism]]
3. Secure Application [[Encapsulation]]
4. Easily scalable small to large application
5. Easier troubleshooting of code [[modularity]]
### Disadvantage of OOPs

1. Not suitable for small applications
2. Consuming time while planning. 

## Other Important OOP Concepts
1. [[Class]]: A blueprint for creating [[Object]]s. It defines the [[Properties]] and methods that an object of the class with have.
2. [[Object]]: An instance of a [[Class]], representing a specific implementation of the class.
3. [[Constructor]]: A special method used to initialize objects of a class.
4. Destructor: A [[method]] called when an [[Object]] is destroyed clean up resources.
5. Access Modifiers : Keywords like [[public]] ,[[private]], [[protected]], [[internal]], etc., which define the accessibility of class members.
